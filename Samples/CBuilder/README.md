# Soluling's C++Builder Samples

This directory contains Soluling's C++Builder samples. Learn about [C++Builder localization](https://www.soluling.com/Help/Delphi/Index.htm) and read the [VCL localization](https://www.soluling.com/Help/Delphi/VCL.htm) and [FireMonkey localization](https://www.soluling.com/Help/Delphi/FireMonkey.htm) tutorials.

The samples contain full source code but not output files (.exe). Compile the samples by opening the `VCL\CBuilder.groupproj` to C++Builder and compiling it.
